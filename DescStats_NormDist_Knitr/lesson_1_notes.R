# Adam Hendel
# Lesson 1-Normal Probability Distributions

# X ~ N(mu, sigma)
# X is distributed as normal with mean and standard deviation

# Standard Normal Distribution
# z = (x-mean)/sd
# mean of zero and standard deviation of one

# pnorm() quantile to probability
# qnorm() probability to quantile
